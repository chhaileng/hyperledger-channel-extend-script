# Sample scripts for adding new channel to Hyperledger Fabric network (first-network)

1. Copy these files to `first-network` directory.
2. Check `configtx.yaml` file for the commented lines that I made as pattern in order to auto generate the new channel profile.
3. Run `./extend_channel.sh ChannelProfileName`
